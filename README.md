> Better support for website unsubscriping to handle when an email needs to entered, survey filled out, etc.
> Disable unsubscribe button if an email can't be unsubscribed from
> Clean up the unsubscribe icon
> Add bulk-unsubscribe button
> Add tests
> (Optional) Archive any future emails/confirmation emails from the unsubscribed account
